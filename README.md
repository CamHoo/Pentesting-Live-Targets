# IDOR
*Found in Red Page*
1. While logged out, go to the page to view the ‘Find a Salesperson’ page.
2. Click on a name and inspect the URL.
3. From the URL, you can see that the users are being referenced directly by their id. 
4. Enter a new id and see what results are given. 
5. As you can see, I was able to access the records of an ex-employee due to this vulnerability. 
6. Go back to the salesperson page to make sure that this user is not publicly listed.
7. Since the user is not publicly listed, we can confirm that an IDOR vulnerability is present.

# Session Hijacking
*Found in Blue Page*
1. In one browser, log into the website and navigate then navigate to the hacktool/change_session_id.php page. (I used Firefox as the victim and Safari as the attacker)
2. Copy the session id of the logged on user and then open up a different browser.
3. In this browser, navigate to the following URL:
        https://104.198.208.81/blue/public/hacktools/change_session_id.php
4. Paste the session id from the logged on account into the given input field and hit change.
5. In the URL, navigate to a page inside the staff portal that should require logging in to view. I went to the following URL:  https://104.198.208.81/blue/public/staff/users/
6. If the Session Hijacking attack was successful, you should be presented the given page without being required to login first.

2. Attempt to login to a username that you know exists, but use an invalid password.
3. The error message that is output is in bold.
4. Attempt to login to a username that you know does not exist, use any password.

# CSRF
*Found in Red Page*
1. While logged out, go to the salesperson page and choose a person whose information you would like to change.
2. Create a malicious html form with the given user’s id included. It should look something like this:

3. Navigate to the contact page and fill out the form. In the Feedback section insert the filepath to your malicious html form.
4. Log in and enter the filepath into your URL.
5. This will execute the given form, but nothing will be shown in the browser since the results are sent to a hidden iframe.
6. Go to the salespeople menu and navigate to the corresponding ID of the person whose information you changed. 
7. The information is now different, and mirrors that which was specified in the malicious form we crafted.
