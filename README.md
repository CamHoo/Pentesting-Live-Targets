*Found in Red Page*
1. While logged out, go to the page to view the ‘Find a Salesperson’ page.
2. Click on a name and inspect the URL.
3. From the URL, you can see that the users are being referenced directly by their id. 
4. Enter a new id and see what results are given. 
5. As you can see, I was able to access the records of an ex-employee due to this vulnerability. 
6. Go back to the salesperson page to make sure that this user is not publicly listed.
7. Since the user is not publicly listed, we can confirm that an IDOR vulnerability is present.
